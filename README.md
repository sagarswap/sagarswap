# Welcome to my Profile

I am a Data Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology, NY with a background in Software Development and Data Engineering. An avid Java developer who loves to explore intricate applications of Data Strcutures and Algorithms in a Software on a fundamental level. This in turn really helped me understand the intricacies of the various ML Algorithms I now implement as a Data Science Student.


# Skills

While I am skilled in C++, Java and Python my language preference really depends on the usecase. 
* If the project requires me to work with complex Data Structures, I will always choose C++. Probably the only GPL to implement pointers properly.
* If I need to make an extensible production grade Application, my go to is Java. Since it implicitly deals with a lot of intricacies of C++ (like garbage collection and memory allocation). Also, its easy to find developers to collaborate with.
* I prefer Python for anything Data Science or Data Processing. When it comes to ML libraries, nothing comes close to it.

Beyond GPL, I also have experience with SQL and packages like ReactJS, Java Spring, numPy, pandas, networkX and Android Studio.
